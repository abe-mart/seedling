  - `PUT /api/daily-prompts/preferences` - Update preferences
  - `GET /api/daily-prompts/:logId` - Get prompt with magic link auth
  - `POST /api/daily-prompts/:logId/respond` - Submit response
  - `POST /api/daily-prompts/skip/:logId` - Skip a prompt
  - `GET /api/daily-prompts/history` - View prompt history

### 4. Frontend Components ‚úÖ

#### Daily Prompt Write Page
- **File:** `v2/src/components/DailyPromptWrite.tsx`
- **Route:** `/write/:logId?token=...`
- **Features:**
  - Beautiful gradient design with StorySeed branding
  - Magic link authentication
  - Write responses directly from email
  - Word count tracking
  - Skip functionality
  - Already-responded state handling

### 5. Configuration ‚úÖ
- **Dependencies installed:** resend, node-cron, jsonwebtoken, date-fns, date-fns-tz
- **Environment variables added to .env:**
  - `RESEND_API_KEY` (needs user's API key)
  - `RESEND_FROM_EMAIL=StorySeed <hello@storyseed.martinapps.org>`
  - `JWT_SECRET` (generated secure key)
  - `BASE_URL=http://localhost:5176`
- **PM2 Ecosystem:** Updated with scheduler process

### 6. Routes Added ‚úÖ
- **File:** `v2/src/App.tsx`
- `/write/:logId` - Public route with magic link auth
- `/settings` - Protected route for user preferences

## Architecture Highlights

### Intelligent Prompt Selection
The system intelligently selects prompts by:
1. Prioritizing story elements with fewer responses
2. Avoiding repetition within configurable days
3. Respecting user's prompt type preferences
4. Focusing on specific story if configured
5. Rotating through different prompt types

### Magic Link Authentication
- JWT tokens generated for each prompt
- 24-hour expiration
- Token includes: promptLogId, userId
- Allows password-free access to write page
- Secure and convenient

### Email Formats

**Minimal:** Clean, simple design - just the prompt
**Detailed:** Includes story context, element details, rich design
**Inspirational:** Motivational quotes, beautiful hero section, centered layout

### Streak Protection
- Tracks consecutive skips
- Auto-pauses after threshold (default: 3 skips)
- Sends warning emails when approaching threshold
- Resets on successful response

## PM2 Processes

```
seedling-v2          - Main web server (port 3005)
seedling-scheduler   - Daily prompts cron scheduler
```

Both processes are running and configured in `ecosystem.config.cjs`.

## Current Status

### ‚úÖ Completed
- Database migration executed
- All backend services implemented
- Email templates created (3 formats)
- Frontend pages built
- Routes configured
- PM2 processes running
- Build successful

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Requires Configuration
User needs to add their Resend API key to `/home/pi/seedling/v2/.env`:
```env
RESEND_API_KEY=your_actual_api_key_here
```

### üß™ Ready for Testing
Once the Resend API key is added, test by:
1. Visit `/settings` in the app
2. Enable daily prompts
3. Configure delivery time and preferences
4. Wait for scheduled delivery OR
5. Temporarily modify cron schedule for immediate testing

## Smart Features

### Focus Underdeveloped Elements
Prioritizes story elements in the bottom 30% by response count.

### Avoid Repetition
Tracks recent prompts and avoids repeating:
- Same prompt types within X days (default: 7)
- Same elements within timeframe

### Context-Aware
Optionally includes:
- Element descriptions
- Previous responses for continuity
- Story context

### User Preferences
- Delivery time with timezone support
- Story focus (all or specific)
- Prompt type filters
- Email format preference
- Smart feature toggles

## Email Flow

1. **Cron triggers hourly**
2. **Check users** needing prompts (based on timezone + delivery time)
3. **Generate prompt** using intelligent selection
4. **Send email** via Resend with magic link
5. **User clicks** "Write Now" button
6. **Opens `/write/:logId?token=...`** page
7. **Write response** or skip
8. **Response saved** to database
9. **Streak updated** or skip counted

## Next Steps

1. **Add Resend API key** to .env file
2. **Test email delivery** with a real user account
3. **Verify magic links** work correctly
4. **Check scheduler logs** to ensure prompts are sent
5. **Monitor streak functionality**
6. **Consider adding:**
   - Weekly summary emails
   - Response history view
   - Prompt preview in settings
   - Email testing/preview feature
