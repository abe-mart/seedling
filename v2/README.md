## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React 18 with TypeScript
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
- **Icons**: Lucide React
- **Build Tool**: Vite
- **Database**: Supabase (PostgreSQL)
- **Authentication**: Supabase Auth

## Prerequisites

Before running this project locally, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Node.js** (version 18 or higher)
- **npm** (comes with Node.js)
- **Git** (for cloning the repository)

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone <your-repository-url>
cd project
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Environment Setup

The project is pre-configured with Supabase connection details. The `.env` file already contains:

```
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=https://0ec90b57d6e95fcbda19832f.supabase.co
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=<anon-key>
```

**Note**: These environment variables are already set up and connected to a working Supabase instance with the required database schema.

### 4. Database Schema

The database has been initialized with the following tables:

- **profiles** - User profile information and streak tracking
- **series** - Story series/universes
- **books** - Individual books/projects within series
- **story_elements** - Characters, locations, plot points, items, and themes
- **prompts** - Generated writing prompts
- **responses** - User responses to prompts
- **user_settings** - User preferences and settings

All tables include Row Level Security (RLS) policies to ensure users can only access their own data.

### 5. Run the Development Server

```bash
npm run dev
```

The application will start on `http://localhost:5173` (or another port if 5173 is in use).

### 6. Build for Production

To create a production build:

```bash
npm run build
```

The built files will be in the `dist/` directory.

### 7. Preview Production Build

To preview the production build locally:

```bash
npm run preview
```

## Database Information

### Supabase Configuration

The application uses Supabase for:
- **Authentication**: Email/password authentication with automatic profile creation
- **Database**: PostgreSQL database with Row Level Security
- **Real-time**: Potential for real-time updates (not currently implemented)

### Key Database Features

- **Automatic Profile Creation**: Profiles are created automatically on user signup
- **Cascade Deletes**: Deleting a project removes all associated elements
- **Updated Timestamps**: Automatic `updated_at` timestamp updates
- **Streak Calculation**: Smart streak tracking based on consecutive days

## Security

- All database tables use Row Level Security (RLS)
- Users can only access their own data
- Authentication required for all database operations
- Passwords are securely hashed by Supabase Auth

## Troubleshooting

### Port Already in Use

If port 5173 is already in use, Vite will automatically try the next available port. Check the terminal output for the actual port number.

### Database Connection Issues

If you experience connection issues:
1. Check that the `.env` file contains the correct Supabase URL and anon key
2. Verify your internet connection
3. Check the browser console for specific error messages

### Build Errors

If you encounter build errors:
1. Delete `node_modules` and `package-lock.json`
2. Run `npm install` again
3. Run `npm run build`

### Authentication Issues

If authentication doesn't work:
1. Check browser console for error messages
2. Verify Supabase project is active
3. Clear browser cache and cookies
4. Try logging in again

## Browser Support

This application works best on modern browsers:
- Chrome (latest)
- Firefox (latest)
- Safari (latest)
- Edge (latest)
