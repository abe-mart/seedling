## Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone <your-repository-url>
cd project
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Environment Setup

Create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following variables:

```
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
VITE_OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
```

**Required Environment Variables:**

1. **Supabase**: The project is pre-configured with Supabase connection details for the database.
2. **OpenAI API Key**: Required for AI-powered prompt generation
   - Get your API key from [OpenAI Platform](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys)
   - The app uses GPT-4o-mini for cost-effective, high-quality prompt generation
   - Typical cost: ~$0.001 per prompt generation

**Important**: Never commit your `.env` file to version control. Use `.env.example` as a template.

### 4. Database Schema

The database has been initialized with the following tables:

- **profiles** - User profile information and streak tracking
- **series** - Story series/universes
- **books** - Individual books/projects within series
- **story_elements** - Characters, locations, plot points, items, and themes
- **prompts** - Generated writing prompts
- **responses** - User responses to prompts
- **user_settings** - User preferences and settings

All tables include Row Level Security (RLS) policies to ensure users can only access their own data.

### 5. Run the Development Server

```bash
npm run dev
```

The application will start on `http://localhost:5173` (or another port if 5173 is in use).

### 6. Build for Production

To create a production build:

```bash
npm run build
```

The built files will be in the `dist/` directory.

### 7. Preview Production Build

To preview the production build locally:

```bash
npm run preview
```

## Usage Guide

### First Time Setup

1. **Sign Up**: Create an account with your email and password
2. **Create a Project**: Click "Create Project" from the dashboard or project manager
3. **Add Story Elements**: Add characters, locations, and other story elements to your project
4. **Generate Your First Prompt**: Click "Generate New Prompt" from the dashboard

### Daily Workflow

1. **Login** to your account
2. **View Dashboard** to see your current streak and recent activity
3. **Select a Story** and optionally choose specific story elements to focus on
4. **Choose a Prompt Mode** that matches what you want to work on today
5. **Generate AI Prompt** - The AI will create a personalized question referencing your story elements and past work
6. **Write Your Response** in the distraction-free editor (auto-saves as you type)
7. **Save & Finish** to complete the prompt and update your streak
8. **Review History** to browse past prompts and responses

### How AI Prompt Generation Works

StorySeed uses OpenAI's GPT-4o-mini to generate highly personalized writing prompts:

1. **Context-Aware**: The AI analyzes your story's title, description, and all story elements
2. **Element-Focused**: Every prompt references at least one story element by name
3. **History Integration**: Past questions and answers are included so the AI builds on previous work
4. **Smart Selection**: If you don't select an element, the AI picks one that makes sense for the prompt mode
5. **Interview Technique**: Questions are designed to draw out YOUR ideas, not write the story for you
6. **Mode-Specific**: Each prompt mode has specialized instructions for the AI to focus on different aspects

**Example**: If you have a character named "Sarah" and select Character Deep Dive mode, the AI might ask:
> "What childhood experience taught Sarah to hide her emotions, and how does this defense mechanism fail her in moments of genuine crisis?"

The AI considers:
- Sarah's existing descriptions and notes
- Past prompts about Sarah and their answers
- Other related story elements
- The character interview approach to deepen your understanding

### Managing Projects

- **Create Projects**: Organize your writing into separate books or stories
- **Add Elements**: Build your story database with characters, locations, plot points, items, and themes
- **Edit Elements**: Update descriptions and notes as your story evolves
- **Delete Elements**: Remove elements that are no longer needed

### Prompt Modes

Choose a prompt mode to focus your writing:

- **General**: Balanced prompts for overall story development
- **Character Deep Dive**: Explore character motivations, fears, and relationships
- **Plot Development**: Expand key events, conflicts, and turning points
- **Worldbuilding**: Develop locations, cultures, systems, and traditions
- **Dialogue Practice**: Practice character voice through conversational scenarios
- **Conflict & Theme**: Examine moral choices and thematic questions

### Streak Tracking

- Complete at least one prompt per day to maintain your streak
- View current and longest streaks on the dashboard
- Streaks reset if you miss a day (unless you wrote the previous day)

## Available Scripts

### `npm run dev`
Starts the development server with hot module replacement

### `npm run build`
Creates an optimized production build

### `npm run preview`
Previews the production build locally

### `npm run lint`
Runs ESLint to check code quality

### `npm run typecheck`
Runs TypeScript compiler to check for type errors

## Database Information

### Supabase Configuration

The application uses Supabase for:
- **Authentication**: Email/password authentication with automatic profile creation
- **Database**: PostgreSQL database with Row Level Security
- **Real-time**: Potential for real-time updates (not currently implemented)

### Key Database Features

- **Automatic Profile Creation**: Profiles are created automatically on user signup
- **Cascade Deletes**: Deleting a project removes all associated elements
- **Updated Timestamps**: Automatic `updated_at` timestamp updates
- **Streak Calculation**: Smart streak tracking based on consecutive days

## Security

- All database tables use Row Level Security (RLS)
- Users can only access their own data
- Authentication required for all database operations
- Passwords are securely hashed by Supabase Auth

## Troubleshooting

### Port Already in Use

If port 5173 is already in use, Vite will automatically try the next available port. Check the terminal output for the actual port number.

### Database Connection Issues

If you experience connection issues:
1. Check that the `.env` file contains the correct Supabase URL and anon key
2. Verify your internet connection
3. Check the browser console for specific error messages

### Build Errors

If you encounter build errors:
1. Delete `node_modules` and `package-lock.json`
2. Run `npm install` again
3. Run `npm run build`

### Authentication Issues

If authentication doesn't work:
1. Check browser console for error messages
2. Verify Supabase project is active
3. Clear browser cache and cookies
4. Try logging in again

## Browser Support

This application works best on modern browsers:
- Chrome (latest)
- Firefox (latest)
- Safari (latest)
- Edge (latest)

## Future Enhancements

Planned features for future releases:
- AI summaries and relationship insights
- Visual relationship maps between story elements
- Export functionality (Markdown, JSON, PDF)
- Series management with multiple books
- Collaborative writing features
- Mobile app version
- Offline support with sync
